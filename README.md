# BlogWebApp

I Use .Net core 2.2 MVC to create a small blog post web app.

In this project Admin can creat, edit, delete posts, pictures, and book.
Regulare user can make a comment to the post and if like book from galery can redirect to page fro buying.

To test the project you don't need to download all the file just visit https://mustafaamish.azurewebsites.net, project is hosted in Azure cloud with Azure dev.
