# BlogWebApp

I Use .Net core 2.2 MVC to create a small blog post web app.

In this project Admin can creat, edit, delete posts, picutrs, and book.
Regulare user can make a comment to the post and if like book from galery can redirect to page fro buying.

I will give Admin password and email for testing to see how its work.
To test the project you don't need to download all the file just visit https://mustafaamish.azurewebsites.net, project is hosted in Azure cloud with Azure dev.
